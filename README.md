# Minesweeper
This is a clone of the original Minesweeper game I played back in the days on Windows XP.  
Technology used:  
- [Go](https://go.dev/)
- [Gio](https://gioui.org/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)

This is a toy project that I created to get my hands dirty with *Gio*.  
The redux pattern is poorly implemented and misses almost everything from the official spec.  

## Install
`go install github.com/skaldesh/minesweeper`

## TODO
- Add inputs to change grid size, #seconds and #mines.
- Choose a font that supports emojis.
